                <p>
                I decided to take Information Technology long before I even finish my High School studies, 
                back then I was already self-taught by studying about programming languages through the internet. 
                My primary reason why I chose <span className='IT'>Information Technology</span>  as my bachelorâ€™s degree is because of my
                passion in programming. I can see myself not being bored at all as long as I can continually
                practice my passion. It also came to my thinking that I can never go wrong with studying 
                technology, because it is definitely a good field to exert my efforts on.
